## Design choices

   I decided to keep to a theme of green font and foreground colours on a white background as green is the colour of football pitches. This also keep a clear continuity with the theme throughout the site so that navigation can be very easy to learn and becomes familiar quickly. I also wanted to not have too many elements on each page as well to help the user of the site navigate and not be distracted unnecessarily.

I tested the site using the jigsaw css validater and the W3C html validater. All errors that were reported in the code have been fixed with pictures of the results below.

I also tested the site for mobile and desktop using Lighthouse which is part of the dev tools in Google Chrome browser, to get a quicker load time on mobile I ensured all images were compressed using the TinyPNG website.

I tested the colour contrast on the site for accessibility using the website https://color.a11y.com/

I also used the website [Am I responsive](https://ui.dev/amiresponsive) to check the responsive design of the site the image is at the top of the readme file.

## Bug fixes 

  * I found the gallery page was taking too long to load on mobile devices and a bit too long on desktops as well so I re-downloaded all of the images in a smaller size and also used https://tinypng.com/ to compress the images further to speed up loading times.

  * Upon deploying the website I found that my images were not loading in the gallery and my CSS was also not loading I found that the file paths were incorrect so updated all file paths to correct the error in the code.

  * I have tested the site extensively to ensure no bugs remain.

  2. Select the project repsitory I want to deploy.
  3. Select settings in the above menu.

  * General code queries and issues were researched and answered with [W3 Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/) and [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) also Google to issues I had with placing my footer.

  * I used code from the Love running project to help with setting up the gallery page.

  * I used code from the Love running project to underline my active page in the header.

  * I used code from this website https://alvarotrigo.com/blog/hamburger-menu-css-responsive/ to make the hamburger menu  I chnged one or two lines of code 
    to suit my project as I only wanted the hamburger menu to appear on smaller device screens.

  * Notes made throughout the Code Institute course helped massively as well.
